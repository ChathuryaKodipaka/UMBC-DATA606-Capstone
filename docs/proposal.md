## Background
### What is it about?
This project focuses on developing an emotion-based music recommendation system that uses facial emotion detection to suggest personalized music tracks. By analyzing facial expressions captured from images, the system detects the user's current emotional state and recommends corresponding songs from a curated Spotify music dataset that matches or enhances the detected mood.

### Why does it matter? 
Music plays a crucial role in influencing and enhancing emotions, making it a powerful tool for mood regulation and personal well-being. Traditional music recommendation systems rely on user preferences or listening history, but they often fail to capture the userâ€™s current emotional state. An emotion-based recommendation system addresses this gap by offering real-time, personalized music experiences that can uplift, calm, or energize users based on their detected emotions. This approach has significant potential in areas such as mental health, entertainment, and personalized user experiences.

### Research Questions

1. How accurately can facial emotion detection models classify emotions from images?
2. Which machine learning models (e.g., CNNs, VGG16, ResNet) are most effective in detecting facial emotions, and how do preprocessing techniques like image augmentation and normalization impact their performance?
## 3. Data
### Data sources:

### 1. FER-2013 Dataset
- **Description**: [Kaggle - FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The model categorizes each face based on the shown emotion into one of seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, or Neutral (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).
- **Data Size**: 63 MB
- **Data Shape**: (# of rows and # columns)

- **What does each row represent?** 
  Each row represents a 48x48 pixel grayscale image of a human face along with a label indicating the emotion displayed in the image.

## 4. xploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Image Consistency Verification: Color and Size
To ensure data quality and uniformity, a preliminary analysis was conducted on the FER-2013 dataset images. A subset of images from each emotion class in both the training and testing datasets was evaluated to verify the color format and image dimensions. All images were in grayscale and consistently measured 48x48 pixels across all classes.
