## Background
### What is it about?
This project focuses on developing an emotion-based music recommendation system that uses facial emotion detection to suggest personalized music tracks. By analyzing facial expressions captured from images, the system detects the user's current emotional state and recommends corresponding songs from a curated Spotify music dataset that matches or enhances the detected mood.

### Why does it matter? 
Music plays a crucial role in influencing and enhancing emotions, making it a powerful tool for mood regulation and personal well-being. Traditional music recommendation systems rely on user preferences or listening history, but they often fail to capture the userâ€™s current emotional state. An emotion-based recommendation system addresses this gap by offering real-time, personalized music experiences that can uplift, calm, or energize users based on their detected emotions. This approach has significant potential in areas such as mental health, entertainment, and personalized user experiences.

### Research Questions

1. How accurately can facial emotion detection models classify emotions from images?
2. Which machine learning models (e.g., CNNs, VGG16, ResNet) are most effective in detecting facial emotions, and how do preprocessing techniques like image augmentation and normalization impact their performance?
## 3. Data
### Data sources:

### 1. FER-2013 Dataset
- **Description**: [Kaggle - FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The model categorizes each face based on the shown emotion into one of seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, or Neutral (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).

| Train Loss          | 0.82      | 0.73            | 0.78                 | 0.86        |
| Validation Accuracy | 0.66      | 0.67            | 0.67                 | 0.63        |
| Validation Loss     | 0.95      | 0.94            | 1.11                 | 1.01        |

Top Accuracy: ResNet50V2 and EfficientNetB0 achieved the highest test accuracy (0.68), showing strong generalization capabilities on unseen data. This indicates both models handle emotion classification effectively, even with limited training samples for certain emotions.

Efficient Convergence: ResNet50V2 reached optimal performance by epoch 15, demonstrating fast convergence and suggesting it requires fewer epochs compared to CNN and EfficientNetB0. This efficiency makes ResNet50V2 particularly suitable for applications requiring rapid training or deployment.

Consistent Loss Metrics: ResNet50V2 exhibited the lowest training loss (0.73) and validation loss (0.94), indicating stable learning across datasets without significant overfitting. This consistency suggests ResNet50V2 adapts well to the dataset and captures distinguishing features for emotion classification.

Overfitting in EfficientNetB0: Although EfficientNetB0 achieved the highest training accuracy (0.76), its higher validation loss (1.11) points to mild overfitting. This outcome may stem from the modelâ€™s complexity, which could benefit from additional regularization techniques for improved generalization.

VGG16â€™s Relative Performance: VGG16, while straightforward and effective, showed lower test accuracy (0.63) and higher loss values. This suggests that VGG16 may struggle with certain emotions or subtle expressions, making it less robust than ResNet50V2 and EfficientNetB0 for this specific dataset.

Summary: ResNet50V2 emerged as the most consistent model, balancing accuracy and loss across training, validation, and test sets. Its stability, fast convergence, and low loss values make it a strong candidate for deployment. While EfficientNetB0 and CNN also show promise, they may require further regularization to enhance their generalization on new data.
